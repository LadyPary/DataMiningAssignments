<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Assignments
This repository contains my data mining assignments separated into individual folders. Each folder contains the *colab notebook* and a comprehensive *report*. Famous data mining tasks has been practiced in these assignments. You can find more details about each one on the **usage** section.

### Built With
* [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
* [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
 - Google Colaboratory

### Usage
In each folder click on the **ipynb file**. Then click on the **Open in Colab** badge. Please note that you need a google account to use colab.
You can easily navigate through the assignment using the *Table of contents*.

### 1- Basic Classification and Plots 
Given the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit and a brief description, the **"Blood Transfusion Service Center"** is a classification problem solved in this assignment. 

You can find the full report and the notebook in the first folder. 

### 2- Classification Algorithms, PCA, and Parameter Tuning
Part one is a classification problem on the **Maternal Health Risk Dataset**,  using **Decision Tree**, **K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)**, **Support Vector Machine(SVM)**, and **Random Forest** classification algorithms.  **Parameter tuning** is performed using **cross validation**.

Part two is a classification problem on the **Parkinson's Disease Classification Dataset**,  using **Decision Tree**, **K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)**, **Support Vector Machine(SVM)**, and **Random Forest** classification algorithms.  **Feature extraction** is performed using **PCA**.

You can find the full report and the notebook in the second folder. 

### 3- MLP and Clustering Algorithms
Part one is a classification problem on the **Labeled Faces in the Wild Face Recognition Dataset**,  using **multilayer perceptrons** classification algorithm.  **Parameter tuning** is performed using **grid search** and **PCA** is used for dimensionality reduction.

Part two is a clustering problem on a **dataset of points on a 2d plane**,  using **Lloyd's k-means**, **Fuzzy C-means**, and **DBSCAN** clustering algorithms.  **The Elbow method** is used to find the optimal number of clusters.

You can find the full report and the notebook in the third folder.
